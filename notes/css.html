        <h3>Intro To Css</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>To link the css and html files together you put link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" 
                (all in opening and closing brackets) in the head tag on the html file</li>
            <li>To make comments in css you write /* as a opening and */ for closing</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Divs and Spans</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A type selector like div will select all elements of the given element type, div is a 
                block element, meaning using it as a selector will result in a separation, by default it will be stacked one on top of another</li>
            <li>A Span is an inline element which appears inline, similar to an a tag</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Classes and IDs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A class elector will select all elements with the given class, you use them like this 
                div class=“alert-text”>BOOM /div, then in the css file you would put .alert-text{color:red;}, 
                classes start with a period in the css file, this will result in the text selected by the class 
                selector to turn the text red.
            </li>
            <li>You can select certain tags inside a div by adding the tag after the class or id, like so:
                 .body-text p {} This will select all the p tags inside the body-text div
            </li>
            <li>ID selectors are similar to class selectors, the major difference is that an element can only 
                have one id and an id cannot be repeated on a single page, and they start with a # in the css file
            </li>
            <li>When two different selectors have similar declarations you can group them together with a comma separating them</li>
            <li>Another thing you can do with the class attribute is to add multiple classes to a single element as a space-separated list, 
                such as class="alert-text severe-alert"
            </li>
            <li>You can also chain two classes together for example ; div class="subsection header">Latest Posts/div can be linked together 
                in the css file like so .subsection.header{color: red;} what this will do is it will select any element that has both the subsection 
                and header classes notice there isn’t any space between the class selectors in the css file; note you can only chain selectors of the 
                same type
            </li>
            <li>color: will obviously change the color of your element
            </li>
            <li>background-color: will change the background color of your element</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</body>
