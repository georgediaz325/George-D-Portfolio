    <h1>HTML Notes</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>Your homepage file should always be named index.html/li>
        <li>You  can put a single exclamation mark at the beginning of the code
            to automatically import a boilerplate.
        </li>
        <li>To open the web page from the terminal navigate to the directory 
            containing the index.html file and type “open ./ “followed by the file
             name”</li>
        <li>h tags are used for headings and they can go all the way down 
            to h6; 1 being the largest and 6 being the smallest</li>
        <li>p tags are used for paragraphs and will add breaks between your text</li>
        <li>strong tags make your text bold, this tag can be used within paragraphs
             wrapping around words, this tag tells your Webpage that this text is
              important
        </li>
        <li>em tags make text italic, this tag can also be used in paragraphs
             like the strong tag
        </li>
        <li>!- - will allow you to make comments not visible on the website, 
            make sure to close it with - -> </li>
        <li>ul makes unordered lists, for each item in the list the item 
            starts with a li tag</li>
        <li>olmakes ordered lists, for each item in this lists each item 
            starts with a li tag as well
        </li>
        <li>a tags will add links, the opening tag consists of two parts, 
            a name, and a value, in the case for links you would add 
            href after the a tag then followed by the link in quotes, 
            eg. <a href=“google.com”>click me</a>
        </li>
        <li>To make a new page on the same site to be able to use links across,
             make a new file in the same parent directory , when the files are in 
             the same directory you can simply put the file name as the href value, 
             eg. a href=“about.html”
        </li>
        <li>Its best practice to give each page its own directory, for example the 
            about page vs the home page, when linking a page from a different 
            directory just put the directory name infront of the file with ./ 
            leading it, eg a href=“./pages/about.html”
        </li>
        <li>Using img src=“”> you can add images to your webpage, if its 
            downloaded on your computer you can make a new directory and link 
            it. ex. img src=“images/dog.jpg” alt =“An Image of a dog”>; you should 
            always include an alt tag, it will add a description in the cases where 
            your image does not load</li>
        <li>using ../ allows you to use files outside of the directory you 
            are currently in, for example, you can use ../ to access your images 
            directory while in your pages directory</li>
